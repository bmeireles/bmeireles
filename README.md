# Hi, I'm Ludmila ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub

## A little bit about me :raising_hand:
I have a Bachelor degree in Information Systems from Ceuma University, and during the course I had several experiences in the technology field, both in academia and industry. I'm currently studying to complete my Master's degree in Computer Science at the Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos.

Because of my background, I have a great interest in Software development with C++ and Python, and Iâ€™m very open to learn other languages too. I used C++, Qt and SQL to develop Mobile apps like <a href="https://github.com/bmeireles/myOdonto"><b>My Odonto</b></a> , and also Automotive systems. With Python, I worked on Machine Learning and EdTech projects. My Masterâ€™s thesis, which is a Transformer model for NILM data analysis, is also being developed in Python.

Iâ€™m currently working on a mentorship with <a href="https://github.com/marcodotcastro"><b>Marco Castro</b></a> , where the team is building Microservices, with the best practices of Agile methodologies and responsible AI for coding. Iâ€™m also taking courses on FastAPI and Azure.
